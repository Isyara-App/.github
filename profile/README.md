# Background
In Indonesia, a large number of deaf and hard-of-hearing people face significant communication barriers due to their hearing impairments. The challenges lies in the general public's limited understanding of sign languages used by the deaf and hard-of-hearing people, specifically Bahasa Isyarat Indonesia (BISINDO). Therefore, we built an application that hopefully will close this interaction gap. The main feature of the application is to provide a real-time sign language translation from the phoneâ€™s camera, after the letter is detected, users can add the letter and combine it to form a word. There are also dictionaries, quizzes and the latest informations.
